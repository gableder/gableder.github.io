# Activity 1: Register for Classes (Static)

Phone-sized HTML/CSS implementation of the opening screen from the high-fidelity prototype.

## Run
Just open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build steps, no JS.

## Notes
- Fixed viewport to **390Ã—844** to emulate an iPhone screen.
- All inputs are non-interactive (static) by design per assignment.
- Icons are emoji to avoid external libraries.

## Attributions
- Layout and starter code assisted by ChatGPT (static HTML/CSS scaffold). Final styling and content adapted by Gabrielle Lederman
- Font: Google Fonts (Inter).
- Icons: Uicons by Flaticon
