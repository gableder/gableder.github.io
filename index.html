                which is the number one card of the Major Arcana in most traditional Tarot decks. The 
                illustration shows a man standing at a table with one hand pointed to the sky and the 
                other pointing to the ground, embodying the phrase 'as above, so below'. On the table, 
                there are various symbolic items typically associated with the Magician: a cup, a pentacle, 
                a sword, and a wand, each representing the four suits of the tarot and the four elements. 
                Above his head is the infinity symbol, signifying infinite potential and knowledge. The 
                background is yellow, indicating optimism and energy, and the table is set upon a lush garden, 
                which suggests growth and flourishing potential. The card is bordered by red roses and white lilies, 
                representing desire and purity respectively. The word 'THE MAGICIAN' is inscribed at the bottom."> </a>

            <a href="#hidden2"> <img class="hoverImages" src="Wheel_Of_Fortune.png" alt="This image is of 'The Wheel of Fortune' tarot card, 
                which is the tenth card of the Major Arcana in traditional Tarot decks. The card features a large 
                wheel in the center with alchemical symbols and Hebrew letters that spell out 'YHWH' (Yahweh), the 
                name of God in Judaism. There are also the letters 'TARO' that can be read in the wheel, which 
                relate to the tarot and also to the word 'rota', meaning wheel. On the wheel are three figures: 
                a sphinx sitting on top, a snake on the left descending, and on the right, Anubis (or a devil-like figure) 
                is ascending. Surrounding the wheel are four winged creatures, each holding a book, in the corners of the
                card, representing the four evangelists of the Christian tradition or the four fixed signs of the zodiac. 
                The background is a sky-blue color, suggesting the celestial element of fate. The phrase 'WHEEL of FORTUNE' 
                is written at the bottom. The imagery represents the cyclical nature of fate and destiny, the ups and downs 
                of life, and the principle that all circumstances are temporary and subject to change."> </a>
